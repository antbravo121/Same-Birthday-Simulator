# Same-Birthday-Simulator
Description:

This project is a python written simulator that illustrates the famous birthday problem in statistics.
The birthday problem takes a room of people and determines what the chance is that two people share 
the same birthday. For this project, I neglected leap years and to generate a list of people with different
birthdays I used python's random module. Birthdays are represents as a single number from 1 to 365.
